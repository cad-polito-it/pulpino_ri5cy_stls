## Engineers' comment :scroll:

A divide and conquer approach was followed to test every unit of the processor independently from the rest to ease the complexity of the problem. Some degree of automation was used, specifically for the instruction set test by the means of a scripting programming language of choice. The assembly routines are described below.

1. `rf_march_c.S`
2. `csr_march_c.S`

Routine(s) that implements the C march algorithm to test for faults in the register file and the CSR file of the processor respectively. 

3. `mem_test.S`

Routine that tests for faults in the load and store unit of the core. The test is divided into two parts called respectively deep addressing and playground. Deep addressing performs multiple reads over the span of the memory, while playground "plays" in a limited region of memory read/write instructions with different instructions.

4. `insn_test.S`

Script-generated routine to test for faults by issuing all instructions with valid random operands. Multiple loops are created by resorting to the functionality of the hardware loops (hence, testing the corresponding logic blocks as well in the process). An array of random values is stored in memory and used for non immediate values. Operand registers are cycled between each instruction to improve register file coverage.Results are stored into memory incrementally and overwritten by the next tested instruction. Instruction tests are generated by filling templates for each type of instruction. Below, is an example of a register-register instruction template.

```
[ 1] lui x1, %hi(inputs)
[ 2] addi x1, x1, %lo(inputs)
[ 3] lui x2, %hi(outputs)
[ 4] lui x2, x2, %lo(outputs)
[ 5] lp.setupi x0, <ITERS>, ins_loop<INDEX>
[ 6] lw <REG_A>, 0x0(x1)
[ 7] lw <REG_B>, 0x0(x1)
[ 8] addi x1, x1, 4 
[ 9] <INSN> <RD>, <RA>, <RB>
[10] sw <RD>, 0x0(x2)
[11] ins_loop<INDEX>:
[12]     addi x2, x2, 4
```
Values enclosed in `<>` are placeholders that are replaced.



## Statistics :chart_with_upwards_trend:

| Unit                              | \#Faults |Fault Coverage* |
|:----------------------------------|:---------|:--------------:|
| `top`                             | 161,036  | 80.23 %        |
|                                   |          |                |
|**Test Application Time (cc)\*\*** | 80,455   |                | 


\* Fault coverage achieved on the gate-level of the core (ri5cy), synthesized using the Nangate 45nm technology library, under the stuck-at fault model.

\*\* Clock period set to 10 ns.
